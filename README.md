# portfolio-generator

## Description:

* This website is designed to help coding professionals to automatically generate their portfolios by entering a set of terminal commands.
* This project was completed based on the Node.js concepts, the fs modules, and 3rd-party npm library-inquirer.
* I have learned the ways to start working at the back-end of javaScript development using node.js, by running the program in the command window(Git Bash Shell).
* I have also learned how to optimize the user experience by building asynchronous codes, improving the code readability by modularizing the code blocks.
* Cation: Welcome to the back-end environment! You need to clone the repo && install the npm inquirer before you can experience this application.


## Built By:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* npm (inquirer)

## How to Install:

* Open Gitbash/terminal, navigate towards your project location from your root by using "cd ./ project location"
* Choose a clone option from the "portfolio-generator" repository (either HTTPS or SSH should work)
* In Gitbash, type "git clone HTTPS or SSH"
* Once the clone is successful, navigate to the root directory of this repo.
* Enter `npm init` into the terminal.
* Enter `npm install inquirer` into the terminal to install the inquirer package and you are good to go!
